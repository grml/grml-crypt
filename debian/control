Description: wrapper around cryptsetup-luks
 This software should provide an easy wrapper around cryptsetup-luks,
 losetup and mount.
 It is possible to create and mount an encrypted filesystem image with
 only one command. This wrapper handles devices and filesystem-images
 and implements an efficient but also secure initialisation algorithm.
